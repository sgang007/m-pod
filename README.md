Music Pod is a great hand-held device for creating music, songs and video with an easy UI

There are 3 levels to create music - Basic/Advanced/Expert

The Basic Interface:
--------------------------------------
It is for people who do not know anything about music. Only imagination itself can create music.

Step 1: People create a rough tempo variation of the song using the touch-screen interface.

Step 2: The beat pattern is generated using the tempo variation

Step 3: Notes-single/collection or note patterns like waltz and blues are inserted in the beats

Step 4: Some instruments and music is added at certain points

Step 5: A template for singing is generated to the music just made

Step 6: People fill the template with syllables of their own

Step 7: The music and lyrics are synchronized and variations are corrected to create a perfect song

Step 8: Some visualizations and video templates are dragged and dropped to create a music video

Step 9: The entire video is uploaded in the cloud of m-store

Step 10: Anyone who wants to buy the music can browse the store and select to buy.
